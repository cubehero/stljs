INTRODUCTION
------------
This is the readme file for version 2.5.0 of the 'stl2pov' program,
released on 2011-06-22.

The purpose of this program is to convert an STL (Standard Triangulation
Language) file (in ASCII or binary format) to a POV-ray mesh object. It
creates either triangles by default, but can generate smooth_trianges. For
more information, see the manual page stl2pov.1.

CHANGES
-------
2.5.0: Add coordinate transform to convert STL to pov-ray coordinate system
2.4.4: Build infrastructure update.
2.4.3: Fix reading big binary stl files on windows.
2.4.2: Reduced some errors to warnings. Made the program somewhat more
       informative.
2.4.1: Add status reporting to monitor progress, especially on big files.
2.4.0: Add option to set allowed distance between vertexes that are assumed
       to be the same.
2.3.0: Follow the new syntax for povray: use 'triangle' instead of 'facet'.
2.2.1: Makefile fixes for better cooperation with FreeBSD ports.
2.2.0: Switch from GPL to 2-clause BSD license. Added FreeBSD port.
2.1.0: Switch to new parser.
2.0.0: Parses binary STL files.

BUILDING THE PROGRAM
--------------------
For building on FreeBSD and other systems with the GNU toolset, see the
instructions in the file INSTALL. After installation, a manual page for
this program can be read with 'man stl2pov'. Additional documentation is
available in the documentation directory. See the Makefile.

I have set up a cross-compiler to produce a win32 binary. You can find it
in the file stl2pov-2.5.0.zip on my website;
http://www.xs4all.nl/~rsmith/software/

If anyone wants to donate makefiles or project files for other systems and
compilers I will be happy to include them in the distribution.
